## Performance Lab Set #2

---

1. Write a Python program to create a Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST) using an array (given) elements where array elements are sorted in ascending order. 
2. Write a Python program to find the closest value of a given target value in a given non-empty Binary Search Tree (BST) of unique values.  
3. Write a Python program to check whether a given a binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST) or not.  

Let a binary search tree (BST) is defined as follows:
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Example 1:
    2
   / \
  1   3

Binary tree [2,1,3], return true.

Example 2:
    1
   / \
  2   3

Binary tree [1,2,3], return false.

4. Write a Python program to delete a node with the given key in a given Binary search tree (BST).  
Note: Search for a node to remove. If the node is found, delete the node.

5. Write a Python program to convert a given array elements to a height balanced Binary Search Tree (BST).  

6. Write a Python program to find the kth smallest element in a given a binary search tree.
